Each crew follows this structure:

```
src/chatbot/crews/[crew_name]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [crew_name]_crew.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents.yaml
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.yaml
```

### **Flow Integration Pattern**:
1. Add intent detection in `chat_method()`
2. Add route handling: `return "route_[crew_name]"`
3. Create listener method: `@listen("route_[crew_name]")`
4. Store results in shared state
5. Return to chat for synthesis

### **State Management**:
```python
class ChatState(BaseModel):
    # Existing fields...
    
    # New crew results
    content_results: Optional[dict] = None
    code_analysis_results: Optional[dict] = None
    business_intel_results: Optional[dict] = None
    # ... add more as needed
```
